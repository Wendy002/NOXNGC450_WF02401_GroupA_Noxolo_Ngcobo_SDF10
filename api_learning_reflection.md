# Overview of Your Project

### Title of the Project: APIs Learning Reflection

### What You Need to Do:
Explore the basic concepts of APIs through a series of lessons and hands-on exercises. This includes understanding what APIs are, how they work, and their applications in software development. You will be guided through interactive lessons, culminating in a learning reflection to consolidate your understanding.

### What You'll Learn:
- The fundamental principles of APIs.
- Different types of APIs and their use cases.
- How to interact with APIs using various tools.
- Real-world applications of APIs in software development.

### What You Need to Include:
- A detailed reflection on 5 key concepts and terms related to APIs.
- Examples and applications for each term and concept.
- A self-assessment checklist evaluating your understanding and skills.
- Responses to reflective questions on your learning experience.

### What to Hand In:
- A completed Learning Reflection, which includes your insights, self-assessments, and an action plan for further learning.

### How to Submit Your Project:
Submit your completed Learning Reflection Template via the course submission portal on the LMS. Ensure all sections are thoroughly completed.

### How We'll Assess Your Work:
Your submission will be assessed on:

- The depth of understanding demonstrated in your reflections.
- The clarity and relevance of examples and applications provided.
- The thoroughness of your self-assessment and action plan.
- Overall engagement with the course material.

## Part 1: Key Terms and Concepts

#### Core Concepts and Key Terms

1. **API (Application Programming Interface)**: Understanding the basic concept, functionality, and purpose of APIs in software development.
    
2. **Interface**: The definition and role of interfaces in technology, and how they differ from APIs.
    
3. **API Components**: Learning the key components that make up an API.
    
4. **Types of APIs**: Differentiating between various types of APIs and their specific roles and applications in technology.
    
5. **Remote (Web) APIs**: Understanding how Remote APIs function, including their request-response mechanism.
    
6. **Client-Server Model**: Grasping the fundamentals of the web, particularly the client-server model, and how APIs operate within this framework.
    
7. **REST (Representational State Transfer)**: Learning the basics of RESTful APIs, including their core principles and applications.
    
8. **API Exploration and Implementation**: Basic operations of online APIs, exploring specific API implementations, and hands-on interaction with API tools.
    
9. **Command-Line API Interaction**: Using command-line tools for API interaction, understanding API authentication methods, and parsing API responses.
    
10. **Curl**: Understanding and using Curl for API interactions, including basic commands and its application in API requests.
    
11. **API Exploration Tools**: Discovering and using various tools for API exploration and interaction, and their application in real-world scenarios.
    
12. **Helper Libraries**: Understanding the role and usage of helper libraries in API interactions and their implementation in programming.

### Your Chosen Terms

**Term/Concept 1:** API (Application Programming Interface) 

**Definition:** APIs are used to link communication of software programns  by providing them with the necessary tools and functions and allowimng smooth software development interactions


**My Understanding (Rate 1-5):** [1 = Not clear, 5 = Very clear] [4] 

**Example/Application:** [weather apps use apis from companies that actually hold that data , more like borrowing/taking snapshot of the data and display data on that app you called the api on ]

**Term/Concept 2:** Interface 

**Definition:**    User interface dictates how its end-users interact with the system in question. 

**My Understanding (Rate 1-5):** [1 = Not clear, 5 = Very clear]  [5]

**Example/Application:** [The waiter would be the interface in the restaurant scenario]

**Term/Concept 3:** Remote web apis  

**Definition:**  APIs used by webistes to connect software program over the network designed using web starndard http/https protocol

**My Understanding (Rate 1-5):** [1 = Not clear, 5 = Very clear]  [4]

**Example/Application:** Twitter API , google maps API

**Term/Concept 4:** Rest API  

**Definition:** This type of api is like a menu where each item is a resource (e.g weather foacast) and uses methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to order/request or cancel/delete using standard http protocol.

**My Understanding (Rate 1-5):** [1 = Not clear, 5 = Very clear] [4]

**Example/Application:** Amazon s3 bucket uses the methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) while adding , removing or updating data.

**Term/Concept 5:** client-server model  

**Definition:**  model where the client(your device) communicates with the server (data center) to respond to requests made by the user on the client(device)

**My Understanding (Rate 1-5):** [1 = Not clear, 5 = Very clear] [5] 

**Example/Application:**  web browsing (google chrome etc)

## Part 2: Self-Assessment Checklists

**Understanding of Key Topics**
- I can explain the main concepts of this module. ✅
- I can give examples of each key term/concept. ✅
- I can apply these concepts to solve problems. ✅

**Skills and Application**
- I can demonstrate the skills taught in this course in a practical context. ✅
- I have practiced these skills through exercises or projects. ✅
- I can critique or analyze scenarios using these concepts. ✅

## Part 3: Reflective Questions

**What was the most interesting thing I learned in this module?**  
- The interesting thing I learned about APIs is how they are integrated into web applications to improve functionality and save time needed to collect services/data required by the site.

**What topic or concept did I find most challenging? Why?**  
- Command line- I'm still not comfortable with the command line and using the commands with ease.

**How can I apply what I've learned from this course to real-life situations or other subjects?**  
- I'm going to start integrating APIs into my projects and I really can't start working with open ai gpts API.

**Do I have any questions or areas where I need more clarification?**  
- Do existing APIs ever get broken then crashes the site?

## Part 4: Action Plan

**Areas for Improvement:**  
- Command Line 
- API authentication

**My Action Plan:**  
- I plan to start using apis for most of my projects going forward , use command line interface so that i get comfortable with it. I plan to do this for the next 4 weeks after sdf11
